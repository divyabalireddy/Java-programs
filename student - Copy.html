                <h2>TCS NextStep Portal Not Opening</h2>
                <p>The TCS Nextstep registration portal not opening is a very common problem. Please do the following -

                    Please check your Internet connection<br/>
                    
                    Enter correct URL: https://nextstep.tcs.com/ in browser<br/>
                    
                    Use Google Chrome or Firefox or Microsoft Edge browser<br/>
                    
                    If none of that works, it's likely that the tcs nexstep registration portal servers are down. Try after 20-30 minutes.</p>
